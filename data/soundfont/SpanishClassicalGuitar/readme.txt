Sound samples recorded from a Spanish classical guitar.
Created by roberto@zenvoid.org for the FreePats project, 2008-2016.

Microphone: AKG Perception 120.
Recorded and processed using free software tools. The recording
conditions were far from ideal, so several filters have been applied to
the samples to reduce noise and improve sound.
